<h1>Bruce's Amazing Race</h1>
<h3>Celebrating Bruce! <br> <br>
	Bruce was born was on the 25th of April 1997, in Pietermaritzburg. From birth it was clear that Bruce was destined for great things. He grew up on a pig farm,
	called Fagazaan just outside Michaelhouse where he enjoyed pondering the meaning of life and treating his body like a temple. At then tender age of 13
	Bruce then left home and went to boarding school at Balgowan high (AKA Michaelhouse) where he was in Tatham house. For reasons unbeknown to him Bruce acquired the nicknames of blood nut 
	and strong hands. Fast forwarding a few years Bruce found himself in Stellenbosch. Here, he was a rather shy introverted chap who avoided most human interaction, 
	rather focusing on his academics and frequenting the library on most nights. On the odd occasion that Bruce allowed himself pleasure of an alocoholic beverage his preferred watering hole was Happy oak,
	followed a small squeeking of the tekkie in catwalk. Due to his studios behaviour Bruce was afforded the opprotunity to go to Lund in Sweden and upon his return he managed
	to con Standard Bank into employing him, the rest he is sure you all know as that is where most of you came into his life.
